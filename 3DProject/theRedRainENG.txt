Why do people betray others?
Surely it's not their intention, it's from weakness.
I won't stop, so I can protect our bond.
(People can't stop fighting for justice.)
Even if I know I'm full of contradiction...
my feelings tremble.
No matter how deeply we hurt each other,
I want to be sure of our bond over and over again.
(I need love.)
Like how the clouds pass and it clears up,
someday hatred will disappear.
Yes, and our wishes will wipe away our overflowing tears.
Lying down atop pain,
I'm searching for warmth.
Even if my body shivers in the cold,
the days revolve, life goes on.
I want to believe
even in sorrow, even in the tears,
until the rain stops,
until the rain stops.
Everything happens for a reason.
(Everything happens for a reason.)
Why must we greet sorrow?
I'm searching for the meaning.
Even if my heart is completely crushed,
surely I'll be able to stand back up over and over.
(Get stronger.)
Like the weeds on the roadside,
even if I fall, I'll look up at the sky and realize
that if I overcome pain, I'll get stronger.
Living atop pain,
I'm searching for the light.
Even if my body shivers in the darkness,
the days revolve, life goes on.
I want to laugh
quietly resting
in the sorrow, in the tears.
When I close my eyes and look back,
I stood still in the downpour.
The red rain from back then, even now, it won't stop.
If I'm able to have the courage
to forgive the loop of repeating pain...
Once more...
Come, let's finish this.
Please no more...
Till the red rain stops,
lying down atop pain,
I'm searching for warmth.
Even if my body shivers in the cold,
the days revolve, life goes on.
I want to believe
even in sorrow, even in the tears,
until the rain stops.
Oh oh, until the rain stops.
Oh oh, until the rain stops.
And I'm gonna go forward.
Life goes on.
