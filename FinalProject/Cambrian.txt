541 million years ago. This is the Cambrian period.
During this period, you see a really primitive creature swimming in the ocean.
It somehow looks like an eel. It sucks blood. This is a lamprey. It has a notochord.
And it survives after millions of years. You can still see it when you return to your time.
It's time to travel again.
