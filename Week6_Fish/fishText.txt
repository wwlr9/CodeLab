The evolution of fish.This is a time-traveling experience. Mouse click to continue. 
541 million years ago. This is the Cambrian period.
During this period, you see a really primitive creature swimming in the ocean.
It somehow looks like an eel. It sucks blood. This is a lamprey. It has a notochord.
And it survives after millions of years. You can still see it when you return to your time.
It's time to travel again.
443.4 million years ago. This is the Silurian period.
In the ocean, you see something look more like a modern fish.
Those are placoderms, fishes starting with jaws. You are a little bit scared by them because they are heavily armored.
You won't see placoderms when you return to your time.
Travel. 419.2 million years ago. This is the Devonian period.
Welcome to the Age of fishes!
You still see swimming placoderms, like a Dunkeleosteous, a large predator jawed fish. But their destiny will be ended during this period.
You see some familiar faces. Fishes without true bones, such as sharks just passing by your side.
And diverse bony fishes are around you. Yes, they are the most fishes we see today.
And some fishes are swimming toward the land.
A weird-look fish grabs your attention. It looks like a tetrapod.
This is Tiktaalik. The fish achieves the transition from the ocean to the land.
The evolution of fish.
From the ocean to the land.
